# mvc-pattern-basics
In this pill you will learn to implement one of the most common architecture 
patterns and you will practice an example following the MVC standards.

## Questions:

1. What is an architecture pattern?  

    First we need to understand software architecture:
    SA is how the how the defining components of a software system are organized
    and assembled (AP). How they communicate with each other (M).
    And the constraints the whole system is ruled by (QA).   

    The architecture its composed by:
    - (AP) Architectural patterns:
    - (M) Messaging mechanisms & API's:
    - (QA) Quality Attributes: scalability, adaptabilitty, performance, security
        ...

2. What is the MVC pattern?  
3. Draw a scheme where you understand that the MVC pattern is clearly  
4. Explain in which cases you would use this pattern   
5. Describe step by step what happens in this pattern from when you create a   
   Request until a Response is returned (you can give more than one example if 
   you consider it necessary).   
6. What advantages do you think this pattern has to use?
